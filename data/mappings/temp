The purpose of this meeting is to explore the appropriate level of validation we want 
to do for external data files based on data sources and message type. Initial cut may be 
to identify number of encounters by patient type (I or O) and count of message types.




For example: AHLTA-T are outpatient encounters
TC2 are inpatient encounters and also include message types LABS/RADS/MEDS/NRS
